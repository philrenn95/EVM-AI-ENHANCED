# EVM-AI-ENHANCED
AI enhancemend of the popular eularian video magnification algorithm 

Original paper of the evm algorithm is used to make small changes of pixels visible to the human eye,

In theory it should be able to detect the human pulse based on a video of the skin. 
Practical applied the algorithm is to dependet on the lightning and the movement. 

This project implements a video vision transformer to enhance the algprithm.
